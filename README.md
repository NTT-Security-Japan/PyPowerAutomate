## Overview

PyPowerAutomate is a Python package designed for creating, managing, and deploying Microsoft Power Automate Flows programmatically. This library provides a simple and efficient way to define Power Automate Flows in JSON format directly from Python code. Whether you're an automation expert, a developer looking to integrate Power Automate into your Python projects, or an enthusiast exploring the realms of workflow automation, Power Automate Library is your go-to tool.

## Features

- **Flow Creation**: Easily define and create Power Automate flows in JSON format.
- **Package Creation**: Easily create a legacy package that could import to Power Automate Platform
- **Customization**: Tailor your flows with dynamic parameters and custom logic.
- **Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Power Automate infrastructure.

## Installation

To install PyPowerAutomate, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install PyPowerAutomate
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from pypowerautomate.flow import Flow
from pypowerautomate.triggers import ManualTrigger
from pypowerautomate.actions import InitVariableAction,IncrementVariableAction,VariableTypes
from pypowerautomate.package import Package

flow = Flow()

flow.set_trigger(ManualTrigger("Button"))

flow.add_top_action(InitVariableAction("action1","a",VariableTypes.integer,1))
flow.append_action(IncrementVariableAction("action2","a",2))

package = Package("incremental_test",flow)
package.export_zipfile()
```

This example creates manual trigger and 2 actions. Then export the flow as legacy package(zip file).
You can import the flow by uploading `incremental_test.zip` to Power Automate.
